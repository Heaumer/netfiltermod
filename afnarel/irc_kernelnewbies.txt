13:11	Afnarel	Hi
13:11	Afnarel	I'm new to kernel programming
13:11	Tectu	Afnarel, please just ask
13:12	Afnarel	I'm trying to get the packets going from one interface to another in a queue
13:13	Afnarel	I tried using netfilter hooks but it doesn't work: the queue size is always equal to 0
13:13		*** DLange joined #kernelnewbies
13:14	Afnarel	I've read this: http://gicl.cs.drexel.edu/people/sevy/network/Linux_network_stack_walkthrough.html
13:15	Afnarel	In "Core (layer 2) output routines:" I can read "if device has a queue (qdisc) ..."
13:16	Afnarel	I think I should use the dev_queue_xmit() function but I don't understand how
13:16	Tectu	Afnarel, it says Linux Network Stack Walkthrough (2.4.20) maybe a little bit too old?
13:17	Afnarel	Does it change a lot ?
13:17	Afnarel	I will try to find a newer version then
13:18	Tectu	yeah, i am pretty sure that there may be a few big changes, but i am not sure. i am new to all this 
stuff to.
13:19		*** eriko joined #kernelnewbies
13:24	Afnarel	I found a newer one for 2.6.37 here
13:24	Afnarel	http://beyond-syntax.com/blog/2011/03/diving-into-linux-networking-i/
13:25	Afnarel	It says "The standard Linux kernel can't keep that pace for an extended period of time it relies on 
buffering to handle short bursts of traffic beyond what it can handle."
13:25	Afnarel	This is the buffer I want to get

13:44	bc547_	Afnarel: netfilter has nothing to do with output queueing
13:45	bc547_	Afnarel: look at qdisc's if you want to implement queueing
13:47		*** kzak quit (Quit: Leaving)
13:52	Afnarel	Ok thanks I'll search in this direction
13:53	bc547_	Afnarel: why do you want to queue them?
13:53	Afnarel	I want to get statistics
13:54	bc547_	like?
13:54		*** albanc joined #kernelnewbies
13:54	Afnarel	I want to know the number of TCP packets in qdisc

13:55		*** kzak joined #kernelnewbies
13:56	bc547_	Afnarel: tc already can show queue stats
13:58	Afnarel	Yes but that's just the first step
14:05	Afnarel	I'm working on a "congestion control protocol with explicit rate notification from forwarding 
devices".

15:53	Afnarel	A research group from the french INRIA is developping it
15:54	vmeson	interesting - is it intended to be general purpose protocol?
